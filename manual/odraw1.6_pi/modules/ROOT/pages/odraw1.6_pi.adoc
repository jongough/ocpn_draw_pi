=== Summary

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_toolbar_icons.png[image,width=44,height=71]

The Ocpn_Draw Plugin (OD) is designed to allow users to place
objects/items on the OpenCPN interface and have these georeferenced.
This allows the objects/items to move with the chart and have a defined
Latitude and Longitude. There are two basic types of object/item that
can be used:

* Points
* Paths

Points are very similar to Waypoints and mark locations on the chart.
Paths join two or more points together and draw a line between them.
Currently these Points exist:

* Boundary Point (BP)
* Text Point (TP)
* Electronic Bearing Line (EBL) Point
* Dead Reckoning (DR) Point
* Guard Zone (GZ) Point

These Points are used to construct special types of Paths:

* Boundary (B)
* Electronic Bearing Line (EBL)
* Dead Reckoning (DR)
* Guard Zone (GZ)
* Parallel Index Line (PIL)

The example screen shot below shows an example of each type of Point and
Path.

One user's Feature Request:

“When Piloting the Range and Bearing of prominent bouys, chart features
can be temporarily important as is the balance of the traffic. AIS
proves the real time value of plotting these dynamic elements.
Additionally, this point is reinforced where (Cursor) Range and Bearing
is shown in places like the Dashboard or Status Bar. However, when
piloting in unfamiliar waters it is useful to maintain an awareness of
multiple landmarks. Much of the dead reckoning situational awareness in
the absence of AIS targets is from Range and Bearing info, especially at
night or in low visibility. A big benefit with respect to maintenance of
situation awareness on deck. These range and bearing datapoints might be
recorded/timestamped when arriving at designated DR waypoints as well.
Range/Bearing Also, Useful when estimating arrival at a layline, given a
known tacking angle and current heading”

His Comment after learning of ODraw:

“Thanks for the redirect. ODraw_PI works great for my purposes. We
should definitely CLOSE this request….”

=== Integration with other plugins

==== WatchDog Alarms

Ocpn_Draw_pi (OD) provides a graphics companion to Watchdog_pi (WD)
Alarms. OD is used as a graphics tool to create Boundary Graphics and
Boundary Point Graphics. WD will then create “Boundary Alarms” using the
Boundary Graphics created by OD. The alarms that WD can create are (GPS
proximity, GPS course & time, Anchor, AIS) depending on the alarm type
WD may require a particular Boundary GUID or the alarm may apply to all
boundaries that are displayed. The WD alarm types are separate and
distinct from the OD graphics types (inclusive, exclusive, neither). OD
knows nothing about the WD plugin, it just responds with information
about specific Lat/Lon combinations. WD can use the graphic type that OD
has to help filter which boundaries to look for. So if you have a large
number of boundaries of mixed 'types' it would probably help if you
selected the type of boundary to look for rather than use the default
'Any'.

===== ODraw and WatchDog interactions

See link:../plugin_messaging.html[plugin_messaging] between ODraw ,
Watchdog and Weather_routing. A simple way to visualise the interactions
between ODraw Boundaries and WatchDog boundaries alarms is laid out in
this chart.

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_wd_interaction_diagram.png[od_wd_interaction_diagram.jpg,title="od_wd_interaction_diagram.jpg",width=401,height=101]

The chart shows which OD Boundary objects will cause a WD alarm to ring.
If the WD alarm is set to Exclusion, the alarm will ring, go off, if an
Exclusion boundary is found within the alarm area, i.e. time or
distance. However, no other type of boundary will cause the alarm to go
off. So when you setup the alarms you need to check the above matrix to
ensure you will get the alarm when you want it.

You can set up multiple Dynamic Guard Zones and set the alarms for one,
some or all of these zones.

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-wdpi-gz-018.jpeg[od-wdpi-gz-018.jpg,title="od-wdpi-gz-018.jpg"]

(Dynamic) Guard Zone Alarms are in some ways similar to the “AIS
Collision Alarm” you can set in OpenCPN (Options-Ships-AIS Targets-CPA
Calculation). But they are more versatile.

==== Weather routing integration

link:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-wx-rte-boundary-guard-zone-grib-clim.jpg.detail.html[image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-wx-rte-boundary-guard-zone-grib-clim.jpeg[Boundary
Routing,title="Boundary Routing",width=600]]

Red hatched Boundary created with Ocpn_Draw and used in Weather Routing
Configuration > Options > Basic Tab > Check “Detect Boundary”

==== Squiddio integration

An extended API has been provisioned to allow other plugins to interact
with the objects that OD supports. A new version of the Squiddio plugin
is available which can make use of OD Text Points for the display of
information. This removes the Squiddio waypoints from OCPN and replaces
them with OD Text Points. This has the effect of decluttering the OCPN
Routes and Waypoints Manager dialog. There is a new, extended,
preferences dialog for Squiddio that allows the user to set various
paramters for use with OD.

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/squiddio_preferences.png[image,width=348,height=796]

As can be seen it is easy to change between OCPN and OD for the display
of Squiddio information. The extra information below the selection of
which component to use is a subset of the settings available for Text
Points. To find out more about Text Points please read further down on
the manual.

==== Import Draw Objects

There are currently two different format files that allow importing of
Draw objects, these are: gpx and csv. Examples of both formats can be
found here:
https://github.com/jongough/ocpn_draw_pi/tree/master/examples. Both of
these formats allow you to generate Draw objects from other data sources
and then import them rather than having to create each object then
modify them to get the correct attributes.

===== GPX

The gpx format is an XML format file and is exactly the same as used by
Draw for storing its objects over a restart. If you look in the
'ocpn_draw_pi/data' directory you will see one or more xml files these
show all the attributes needed for creating a gpx file. Or if you want
to generate your own gpx file then do an export of a single Draw object
of the type you would like to import so that you have the complete
structure which you can then modify and import. The following is an
example (test export paths1.gpx):

===== CSV

The CSV format file is to allow you to use a spreadsheet program to
easily generate objects. Here is an example (test-boundary-import.csv):

[source,code]
----
'c', 'type(B)','name', 'boundary_type', 'visible(t/f)', 'line rgb-colour', 'rgb-fill-colour'
'B','test boundary1','Exclusion','t','rgb(0,255,0)','rgb(255,0,0)'
'c', 'type(BP)', 'name', lat, lon, 'boundary_type', 'visible', 'rings-visible(t/f)', 'rings-number', 'rings-step', 'rings-units(N/K)', 'rings-colour'
'BP','first',-23.00,154.00
'BP','second',-23.5,154.00
'BP','third',-23.5,154.50
'BP','fourth',-23.0,154.50
'/B'
'B','test boundary2','Exclusion'
'BP','first',-22.00,154.00
'BP','second',-22.5,154.00
'BP','third',-22.5,154.50
'BP','fourth',-22.0,154.50
'/B'
'BP','isolated',-22.70,154.70
'c', 'type(TP)', 'name', lat, lon, 'position (t/ct/b/cb/c/r/l)', 'show (a/r/n)', 'visible (t/f)', 'display text'
'TP','my test text point',-22.70,154.70,'cb','a','t','this is one long line and should be treated as such. It is not designed to wrap'
'TP','my multiline text point',-22.90,154.70,'cb','a','t','this is not one long line\n and should not be treated as such.\nIt is designed to wrap'
----

The first label describes the type of line that follows, i.e. 'c' is a
comment, 'B' is a Boundary, etc.

Using this format in a spreadsheet will allow you to easily create
multiple Draw objects and then import them when you have finished.

==== Installation

This version of the plugin requires at least version of OpenCPN 5.xx.yy.
It is not compatible with any version before this. The reason is that
the user interface changed with OCPN 5 and a new graphics library was
used. +
Download the plugin from the Plugin Downloads section of opencpn.org

=== Interface Icons

When OCPN_DRAW_PI is installed and activated you will see two new icons
in the OpenCPN Toolbar, they will always appear together, but depending
on the other plugins that are currently active may appear in different
positions within the toolbar.

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_toolbar_icons.png[image,width=44,height=71]OCPN
Toolbar icons

The top icon is for the Draw Paths and Points Manger, the bottom icon is
the Draw tool that was last used. It can be any of the tools from the
Draw Toolbar below.

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_toolbar.png[image,width=239,height=69]Draw
Toolbar

Depending on the settings you have chosen for Draw this toolbar may
never be displayed, displayed whilst a drawing tool is in use or always
displayed. There are 7 icons to choose between and each activates a
different tool. The currently active tool icon will also show in the
OCPN Toolbar when you are drawing. If you have finished drawing the last
active tool is shown in the OCPN Toolbar for easy, quick, access to the
last tool.

==== Draw Create (bottom icon)

The plugin has an interesting interface with two icons as shown above
for *_Draw Manager_* and *_Draw Create_* . The bottom icon on the OCPN
Toolbar, *_Draw Create,_* is dynamic and will show a different icon
depending on which drawing object type has been selected. Click on the
bottom icon on the OCPN Toolbar and a floating *_Draw Toolbar_* appears
containing *_Draw Tools_* , with the last one used selected by default
(appears depressed). Select the *_Drawing Tool_* needed. The above
*_Draw Tools_* are for _Boundary_, then _Boundary Points_, _Text
points_, _EBL,_ DR, Guard Zone, and Parallel Index Line in that order.
The Drawing Objects that are available are as follows:

* Boundary
* Boundary points
* Text points
* Electronic Bearing Lines (EBL) & Variable Range Marker (VRM)
* Dead Reckoning
* Guard Zone (GZ)
* Parallel Index Line (PIL)

Try drawing several of each type to learn how they work and what they
create. You can select the next tool in sequence by right clicking the
mouse prior to starting to draw. Once a left mouse click has been done
the right click will terminate the 'create' drawing. You can also stop
the 'create' mode by hitting 'Esc', left mouse clicking the selected
tool in the main toolbar or by left mouse clicking on the close icon in
the 'Draw Toolbar'. It sounds complicated, but you will find one of the
methods should meet your normal usage requirements.

Each tool has a cursor icon:

* Boundary: Pencil
* Boundary Point: Red Cross
* Text Point: 'I' icon
* EBL: Red Cross and a line joining the cursor to the boat
* DR: Red Cross
* GZ: Pencil
* PIL: Red Cross

The DR tool does not draw based on the current cursor position, it
brings up a dialog box that allows you to enter the DR information.

When you left mouse click 'OK' the DR line will be drawn based on the
information you have entered. The information that is first displayed is
the default information entered into the properties panel or the current
information available to OpenCPN, i.e. SOG and COG.

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_toolbar_icons.png[image,width=44,height=71]

==== Draw Manager (top icon)

The top Icon is for the *_Draw Manager_* which gives the user control
over each of the _Drawing objects_ that have been created from the *Draw
Toolbar*. Left click on the *_Drawing Manager_* menu and the Path & OD
Point Manager dialog will be displayed. The *_Path & Point Manager_* has
tabs for _Paths, OD Points and Layers_ from which selected Drawing
Objects can be _Shown, Hidden, Deactivated, Centered, Deleted, Exported,
Delete All, and Export All._ Additionally a drawing object's
*_Properties_* can be accessed and changed. First select one or more
*_Drawing Objects_* under a given *_Tab_* . Then select the desired
*_Action_* on the right. For example: Select all *_Drawing Objects_*
under *_Paths Tab_* , then select *_Delete_* . This will remove all of
the *_Drawing Objects_* under *_Path Tab_* . Of course the quick
alternative is to select *_Delete All_* . *_Properties, Deactivate and
Center View_* are greyed out when more than one object is selected.

===== Drawing Manager > Layers

Drawing Objects imported into Layers are static and non editable. Use
Layers in the same way as the OCPN Route and Waypoint manager does, i.e.
Temporary Layers. It will bring in boundaries and points and show or
hide them as required. You can load more than one layer file into the
same layer, just select more than one file in the file manager popup and
they will load into the same layer. To use Layers and move Drawing
Objects into a temporary user created Layer, select them, Export
Selected and then import then from the Layers tab Import.

==== Edit Mode for Draw Objects

First, if you are in the 'create' mode you must terminate this by, Right
Click of mouse, button, Left Click on the tool you are using or hit
'Esc' on the keyboard. Then in the drawing hover over the object you
wish to modify until a square yellow descriptor appears, then right
click. The popup menu's first line will identify the type of drawing
object you have selected. Then there will be a action pick list,
dependent on the object, such as Properties, Move.., Insert..
Deactivate.. Delete. Some drawing objects are made of several parts,
(Boundary, Boundary Points, EBL & VRM, GZ and PIL) so it makes a
difference where you hover and the condition of the object. +
1. To select a Boundary, hover over the edges. To select a boundary
point hover over it. +
2. To select an EBL hover over the ends or the shaft, depending on
whether the EBL is centered on a boat or lat/long the right click
actions will be different. The popup menu list selections should be self
explanatory.

When you have right clicked and selected an action, for example to move
a boundary, text point or boundary point, the point will be highlighted
with a yellow dot. Complete the move by dragging and releasing. For
editing any characteristics such as color, line thickness, font, etc,
use 'Properties', but if you just want to move a point select 'Move'. To
move a point you will need to right click and select move. Having
selected move you will then need to put the cursor over the selected
object, push and hold the left mouse button and drag the object to where
you want it. When you let go of the left mouse button the cursor (what
ever it was showing before) should revert to the standard pointer and
the 'move' process is terminated. If you want to move the object again,
you will have to right click again to get the popup and repeat the
process.

===== Edit Mode for Draw Object Properties

There are multiple ways to access an object's *_Properties_* .

* In *_Path & Point Manager_* double click on a Drawing Object,
*_Properties_* will appear.
* In the Drawing hover over the Drawing Object, right click and pick
*_Properties_* .
* In the Drawing hover over the Drawing Object, double left click,
*_Properties_* will appear.

It is also possible to drill down into an object if it is multi-part,
i.e. get a Boundary properties dialog displayed then right click or
double click any line showing a Boundary point and the properties for
that point will be displayed.

===== Constrained moves

When moving an object you can move it in any direction just by holding
the left hand mouse button down and dragging. If you want to constrain
the movement to horizontal or vertical you need to use the Ctrl key to
only allow vertical movement or the Shift key to only allow horizontal
movement. If you release the key whilst dragging the constraint is
removed. You can press and hold one of the two keys at any time during
the movement, the constraint only applies when the key is held down.
Additionally, when used with EBL pressing Ctrl + Shift at the same time,
will constrain the angle value and allow movement along the angle. This
will also work when perpendicular line is checked.

===== Whole Boundary moves

A boundary can be moved as a single object or a single line of the
boundary can be moved. The default action is to move the whole boundary,
but you can select 'Move Boundary Segment' from the right mouse button
popup menu.

===== Boundary merges

If you have two or more boundaries you can select these and merge the
boundaries together. This is accomplished by hold the Ctrl key down then
left mouse clicking on the boundaries you want to merge. Each boundary
selected will flicker showing it has been selected. If you then right
click on a boundary you will be presented with a merge popup. This will
allow you to merge and keep the current boundaries, this draws a
bounding boundary around the selected boundaries. If you select merge
and delete you will draw a bounding box around the boundaries then the
original boundaries will be deleted. There is no undo, so care needs to
be taken.

=== Available Drawing tools

This section will describe in more detail the drawing tools that are
available with this Plug In.

==== Boundary

link:odraw1.6_pi/boundary_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/boundary_mui.png[image]]

This allows drawing of a closed path joining all points that of the
path. The smallest Boundary has two points, but normal Boundaries will
have three (triangle) or more points. There is no limit to the number of
points, or the size of the Boundary. When drawing points that have
already been placed will be connected togther with the path line. A
rubber band line will be drawn that follows the cursor. The boundary
fill may appear incomplete or strange at this point. However, when the
final point is place and the create process is finished it will correct
itself and display the boundary fill correctly.

If a point is placed in the wrong location carry on laying the other
points. When you have finished the create process you can then edit the
boundary and 'Move', 'Delete' or 'Add' more points to the boundary. If
the whole boundary is in the wrong location it can be moved as a whole
from the right mouse click menu.

The types of boundary you can draw, which can be easily changed after
creation if it is wrong, are:

* Exclusion - The interior of the boundary will have a cross hatch
pattern of the selected color. The type of boundary reported to other
plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Exclusion'.
* Inclusion - A user defined width cross hatch pattern will be drawn
around the outside of the boundary in the selected color. The type of
boundary reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type
'Inclusion'.
* Neither - The boundary will be drawn as a line with no interior or
exterior fill. The type of boundary reported to other plugins, such as
Watchdog, will be of type 'Neither'.

Please Note that these Types (exclusion, inclusion, neither) are
Graphical only, and WatchDog does not use them in setting its internal
alarms. We recommend that these graphic types be used appropriately to
conform with the type of alarm that will be set from within WatchDog,
however they will have NO EFFECT on the WD alarm type.

The type of boundary may change what other plugins do with the
information, or how it is displayed. If using the Watchdog plugin and
you set the boundary anchor watch the alarm will go off if you move
outside of the boundary. If you are motoring/sailing and you have a
proximity boundary watch set then the alarm will go off if you get
closer than the specified distance. The first type of boundary should be
an 'Inclusion' boundary and the second should be an 'Exclusion'
boundary.

Note: A Boundary is a line joining two or more Boundary Points together.
As such, each Boundary Point can have the same capabilities as
individual Boundary Points.

==== Boundary Point

link:odraw1.6_pi/pointbutton_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/pointbutton_mui.png[image]]

This allows the placing of individual points on the chart. They are very
similar to 'Marks' that can be dropped by OpenCPN. However, they have
the capability of being 'Exclusion', 'Inclusion' and 'Neither' boundary
points. This is demonstrated when *Range Rings are Displayed*.

* Exclusion - The interior of the boundary point, from the biggest range
ring, will have a cross hatch pattern of the selected color. The type of
boundary point reported to other plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of
type 'Exclusion'.
* Inclusion - A user defined width cross hatch pattern will be drawn
around the outside of the largest range ring of the boundary point in
the selected color. The type of boundary point reported to other
plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Inclusion'.
* Neither - The boundary range rings will be drawn as a line with no
interior or exterior fill. The type of boundary point reported to other
plugins, such as Watchdog, will be of type 'Neither'.

Please Note that these Types (exclusion, inclusion, neither) are
Graphical only, and WatchDog does not use them in setting its internal
alarms. We recommend that these graphic types be used appropriately to
conform with the type of alarm that will be set from within WatchDog,
however they will have NO EFFECT on the WD alarm type.

Boundary Points continue to be placed on the chart until the drawing
create mode is terminated. This allows the placing of as many points
with single mouse left clicks as the user wishes.

==== Text Point

link:odraw1.6_pi/textpointbutton_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/textpointbutton_mui.png[image]]

This allows the placing of individual Text Points on the chart. They
appear very similar to Boundary Points, but they allow the displaying of
multi-line text in the desired font. They can have range rings, but
these cannot be filled.

The text top left corner of the text is the reference point. There are 7
provided locations:

* Top - which puts the text over the top of the point aligned to the
left edge of the icon with the bottom just clear of the icon
* Top center - which puts the text over the top of the point with the
center of the text aligned to the center of the icon
* Bottom - which puts the top edge just underneath the point aligned to
the left edge of the icon. If you displace the point name the text
should drop enough to show it
* Bottom center - which puts the text underneath the point with the
center of the text aligned to the center of the icon
* center - which puts the text horizontal and vertical center over the
icon.
* Right - which puts the top edge aligned with the top of the icon, the
left hand edge of the text just clear of the right hand side of the icon
* Left - which puts the top edge aligned with the top of the icon, the
text to the left of the icon with the right hand end of the text box
just clear of the icon

The amount the box edge is offset is controlled by 8 settings in the
opencpn ini/conf file. You will find them called:

* DefaultTextTopOffsetX
* DefaultTextTopOffsetY
* DefaultTextBottomOffsetX
* DefaultTextBottomOffsetY
* DefaultTextRightOffsetX
* DefaultTextRightOffsetY
* DefaultTextLeftOffsetX
* DefaultTextLeftOffsetY

These are not in any dialog box as they are very unlikely to be
modified.

Changing the font in the properties box does not apply the font until
the OK button is pressed on the properties box. The word 'Example'
should change to show you the font selected. Changing the font in the
properties box does not apply the font until the OK button is pressed on
the properties box. The word 'Example' should change to show you the
font selected.

When a Text Point is created the 'natural' scale at which it is created
is stored. This is then used to determine what to show when scaling to
larger scales. Currently at twice the natural scale the text gets hidden
and at 8x the natural scale the text box gets hidden. This is currently
hard coded.

To display text for the Text Point you will need to open the properties
for the Text Point and fill in the 'Display Text' tab. This is simple
text and does not allow individual formatting of different parts of the
text. You can pick the font and the font metrics to use for all the text
associated with one text point.

==== Electronic Bearing Line (EBL)

link:odraw1.6_pi/ebl_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/ebl_mui.png[image]]

The EBL always starts attached to the boat with the far end of the line
being placed by left clicking the chart. The default action for the end
point is set in the main properties dialog. The end point can either be
fixed to a Latitude and Longitude or move along with the boat. This
allows the EBL to show the boat moving against a fixed point, i.e.
passing a reef, or to show other objects moving relative to the boat,
i.e. when the boat can tack to get around a bouy.

The EBL can be detached from the boat to allow placing of the start
point where the user left clicks. The EBL can also then have the start
point centerd on the boat but not move or re-attached to the boat.

Variable Range Markers (VRM's) can be displayed as part of the EBL, by
checking a box on the EBL properties (or set the default on the OD
properties) and a range ring will be drawn based on the start point. If
the end point of the EBL is moved the range ring will move with that
point. This allows easily setting up of safety rings around a boat. The
plugin provides additional information when moving the end point of an
EBL/VRM

End Points A & B of an EBL can be in several states: +
1. Associated with Boat position (boat lat long) - Moving with the
boat. +
2. Associated with a fixed position (lat long) - Not Moving with the
boat. +
3. When offset Point B is associated with Boat position (lat long) it
moves relative to the boat position and stays at the same angle.

Right click selections for EBL are +
1. When the EBL start point is attached to the boat… Pick a new start
point. +
2. When the EBL start point is not on the boat.. Center on moving boat
or Center on Lat/Lon (not fixed to the boat)

This flexibilty is useful for Dead Reckoning to have “Fixed” EBL
markers.

The default color is the same as for a 'Boundary Point' and it will draw
1 range ring. If you want to change that then you will need to get to
the start point properties (double click the EBL and double click the
first point), or if the first point is clearly visible, just go to its
properties (right click the point and select properties) and you can
change the number of rings, the colors. The rings cannot be filled.

The VRM colour, by default is set to the same as the default for a
Boundary Point, but once you change the VRM color to be different from
the Boundary Point default then it will stay this way, unless you select
the match option in the right click menu.

There are two ways of changing the VRM color:

. Under properties for the EBL with the VRM showing. Change the EBL
color and the VRM color will also change.
. Under properties for the EBL with the VRM showing get the properties
of the 'boat'/'start' point and change the color.

It may seem strange at first to use an EBL to give you the VRM, but it
makes selecting the VRM easier so that it can be dragged to the size
required as there is a well defined point that can be selected. This is
particularly true if you have many VRM's at one time.

It is not necessary to loop through the _preferences_ to enable the VRM
for one EBL–the settings pop-up double clicking the EBL has all the
necessary entries.

The popup for EBL's contains both the forward and back bearing.

The main properties dialog in the general tab sets whether to use
magnetic bearings or true. If magnetic is used then if you have the
World Magnetic Model installed the variation will be used from that
plugin. If not you will, currently, need to set 'UserMagVariation=0.00'
in the ocpn_draw_pi section of the config file as there is no setting in
the properties dialog for this.

==== Dead Reckoning (DR)

link:odraw1.6_pi/dr_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/dr_mui.png[image]]

This draws a Dead Reckoning line with multiple points along it starting
at the boats current location. As mentioned above, this tool does not
use the mouse click to draw on the chart, rather it uses it to display a
dialog box where the DR information can be entered. When the 'OK' button
is clicked the DR will be created and drawn on the chart. At this point
the line can be modified by changing the points that make it up.
However, this may make the DR line not reflect what you expect as
neither the time/distance between points is maintained, nor is the
COG/SOG. So the DR line at that point becomes more of a line with
possibly little meaning in the context of DR.

==== Guard Zone (GZ)

link:odraw1.6_pi/gz_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/gz_mui.png[image]]

This draws a segment of a torus or doughnut. The centre is the boat and
the angle and size is determined from the two points that are used to
describe the GZ. When the GZ tool is selected the cursor will change to
a pencil and a line will join it to the centre of the boat. When the
left mouse button is clicked the first point of the GZ is dropped. Now
when the mouse pointer is moved an angular segment of a torus is drawn,
the size of which is determined based on where the mouse cursor is. The
second point is dropped when the left mouse button is clicked. This
completes the drawing of the GZ which will now be the default colour and
filled in with a hatch of the default colour.

The GZ can rotate with the boat and be maintained with the heading or
the coarse over ground. Or it can maintain its position relative to the
boat irrespective of which direction the boat is moving. This is set in
the default propertiesd but can also be changed for each individual GZ.

==== Parallel Index Line (PIL)

link:odraw1.6_pi/pil_mui.png.detail.html[image:odraw1.6_pi/pil_mui.png[image]]

Annex to IMO res.A893(21)-Guidelines For Voyage Planning. Section 4-
Appraisal

* “Additional information which should be marked on the charts include:
….. Parallel index lines should also be drawn where appropriate.”

Annex to IMO res.A893(21)-Guidelines For Voyage Planning. Section 6-
Monitoring, point (j)

* “Radar can be used to advantage in monitoring the position of the
vessel by the use of parallel indexing, which is a simple and most
effective way of continuously monitoring that a vessel is maintaining
its track in restricted coastal waters. Parallel indexing can be used in
any situation where a radar-conspicuous navigation mark is available and
it is practicable to monitor continuously the vessel’s position relative
to such an object. It also serves as a valuable check on the vessel’s
progress when using an electronic chart.”

This allows drawing a line which offset from a centre line by a
specified amount. This offset line will move with the boat and can
either rotate with the boat or stay at a specified angle. Drawing a PIL
is the same as drawing an EBL. The index line only shows up when the
centre line has been drawn.

Each PIL centre line can have multiple offset lines. To create more than
the first line right click the centre PIL line and select 'Add Index
Line'. A new index line will be drawn based on the default settings.

End Points A & B of an PIL can be in several states: +
1. Associated with Boat position (boat lat long) - Moving with the
boat. +
2. Associated with a fixed position (lat long) - Not Moving with the
boat. +
3. When offset Point B is associated with Boat position (lat long) it
moves relative to the boat position and stays at the same angle.

Right click selections for PILL are +
1. When the EBL start point is attached to the boat… Pick a new start
point. +
2. When the EBL start point is not on the boat.. Center on moving boat
or Center on Lat/Lon (not fixed to the boat)

The offset line has its own properties box which can be accessed by
either right clicking the offset line or by double left clicking the
offset line.

Each offset line can be moved using either left drag (if enabled) or
right clicking the line and selecting move.

=== Properties dialogs

All objects that have been drawn have a properties dialog associated
with them to allow changing of the objects attributes.

==== Boundary Properties

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_boundary_properties.png[image,width=862,height=603]

You can display the point properties by either double left mouse
clicking on the particular line you want in the Points list or by right
mouse clicking on the line, once it has been selected, and selecting
'Boundary Point Properties' from the popup menu. If you want to remove a
particular point then left click the line to select it. Then right mouse
click on the point and select 'Remove Selected' from the popup menu.

==== Boundary Point Properties

===== Basic

image:../../../manual/boundary_point_properties_basic_dialog.png[image]

These are the properties for the selected Boundary Point. Any changes
here will be made to the selected Boundary Point and, if the 'OK' button
is clicked, will be preserved over a restart.

===== Extended

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_boundary_point_properties_-_extended.png[image,width=425,height=901]

This allows you to stop displaying the Boundary Point on the screen and
change the GUID if you want. You will need to click 'OK' to save the
changes.

==== Text Point Properties

===== Basic

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_text_point_properties_-_basic.png[image,width=425,height=901]

This tab controls the text that is displayed for the Text Point. Any
changes here will be made to the selected Text Point and, if the 'OK'
button is clicked, will be preserved over a restart.

===== Display Text

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-textpoint-properties-display-text.png[image,width=492,height=818]

This tab is used to create and modify the text that will be displayed
with the Text Point. It also allows the setting of values for an
individual Text Point where as in the Preferences you settup the system
wide settings.

===== Extended

This is the same as for a Boundary Point

==== Electronic Bearing Line (EBL) Properties

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_ebl_properties.png[image,width=862,height=635]

==== EBL Point

===== Basic

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_ebl_point_properties.png[image,width=425,height=901]

These are the properties for the selected EBL Point. Any changes here
will be made to the selected EBL Point and, if the 'OK' button is
clicked, will be preserved over a restart.

===== Extended

This is the same as for a Boundary Point.

==== DR Properties

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_dr_properties.png[image,width=292,height=384]

==== DR Point Properties

===== Basic

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_dr_point_properties.png[image,width=425,height=901]

These are the properties for the selected DR Point. Any changes here
will be made to the selected DR Point and, if the 'OK' button is
clicked, will be preserved over a restart.

===== Extended

This is the same as for a Boundary Point

==== Other

*Copy and paste Lat/lon point*

In any of the 'Point' property dialogs you can right click in either the
Lat or Lon and get a drop down menu where you can select:

* Copy
* Copy Lat/Lon
* Paste
* Paste Lat/Lon

These will either copy/past in the selected box or will copy/paste both
the Latitude and Longitude at the same time.

=== Settings

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-settings.png[image]

Options > Plugins > Ocpn Draw > Preferences +
Under Preferences the Tabs are General, Boundary, Boundary Point, Text
Point, Path, EBL, DR, DR Point, Guard Zone, Parallel Index Line, About
and Help where various settings are selected. Generally the defaults
should give a reasonable starting point. However, all the defaults that
are used can be changed from here.

==== General

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-preferences-general.png[image,width=702,height=564]

===== Confirm Object Delete

This setting determines whether a dialog box will be shown asking for
conformation about deleting any objects. With it checked you will be
asked to confirm all deletes, with it unchecked you will be able to
delete any object without being asked for confirmation. If you do delete
an object by mistake and you have 'Nav Object Backups' set to more than
0, you will be able to use one of those backups to restore your objects.

===== Remember properties dialog positions over restart

This setting saves the position of each dialog over a restart. If the
user moves a dialog it will be in the same position when it is displayed
after a restart. If this setting is not checked the default position,
centre of the OCPN screen, will be used when the dialog is first
displayed after a restart

===== Show Magnetic Bearings

If this is checked and there is a magnetic variation available then this
will be applied to all angles that are used within the plugin. If it is
checked and there is no magnetic variation available it will assume a
'0' variation.

===== Allow Left Mouse Button Drag

This setting allows dragging objects by placing the mouse over the
object, pressing and holding the left mouse button and dragging the
object to the desired location.

If this setting is off you will need to right click on the object to get
the popup menu and select move from that. Then you can press and hold
the left mouse button and drag the object.

A word of warning from user Redog: If “Allow Left Mouse Button Drag” is
checked it is very easy to move your entire boundary or zone to a new
location, thus changing all coordinates of waypoints you may have
painstakingly entered. If you only intend to move 1 waypoint leave
unchecked and use right click and move waypoint. If you intend to move
entire zone check this option, it is a brilliant concept and very
useful.

===== Nav Object Backups

This setting determines how many backups to keep of the navigation
objects file. The location of the files can be found in the opencpn.log
file. Each time OpenCPN stops a new copy of the navigation obj file will
be created. The latest file is called 'ODnavobj.xml'.

===== Edge Panning Sensitivity

This is the percentage of the screen size distance from the edge that
will cause the screen to pan when using the drawing tools. The bigger
this number the further from the edge of the screen your pointer will be
when the screen starts panning.

===== Initial Edge Panning Sensitivity

This is the same as above, but is used after a drawing tool is picked
but before the first object is created. This is supplied so that the
screen does not start panning if you move your pointer off of the toll
bar near the edge of the screen.

===== Display Toolbar

The plugin allows you to use two graphical methods of selecting the tool
you wish to draw with:

. The main Toolbar and the right mouse click
. The Draw Toolbar

This setting determines if the tool bar is display and has three
settings

. Never - the toolbar is not displayed
. Whilst Drawing - the toolbar is displayed whilst a drawing tool is
active
. Always - the toolbar will display all the time irrerspective of
whether you are using the plugin.

===== Remove OCPN_Draw settings and restore to default on restart(No)

This setting allows the user to set all settings back to the default
value. If the button has the label 'Yes' and it is clicked this will
ensure that no settings are saved when OCPN is shut down. The text of
the label will be changed to 'Remove OCPN_Draw setting and restore to
default on restart (Yes)' to indicate what will happen. The button label
will now say 'No' indicating what will hapen if it is clicked again.

==== Boundary

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_preferences_-_boundary.png[image,width=589,height=613]

===== Active Line Color

This is the color of an active Boundary Line +
Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the
color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the
platform.

===== Active Fill Color

This is the default color to use for any active Boundary fill hash. When
selected a standard, platform dependent, color picker will be presented.
This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is
supported by the platform.

===== Inactive Line Color

This is the color of an inactive Boundary Line. +
Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the
color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the
platform.

===== Inactive Fill Color

This is the default color to use for any inactive Boundary fill hash.
When selected a standard, platform dependent, color picker will be
presented. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
color that is supported by the platform.

===== Line Width

This is the width of the Boundary Line in pixels. It can be a value
between 1 and 10 pixels.

===== Line Style

This defines how the Boundary Line is drawn. It can be one of the
following:

* Solid
* Dot
* Long Dash
* Short Dash
* Dot Dash

Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the
resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution
screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be
difficult to see.

===== Fill Density

This allows the setting of how transparent the fill hash is. A value of
0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is
fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low
density - you can see through it, high density - you cannot see through
it.

===== Inclusion Boundary Size

This defines, in pixels, how wide the hash is around the outside
Boundary Line when the Boundary is of type 'Inclusion'.

===== Boundary Type

This radio button selection sets the default type for all Boundary.
Points.

* Exclusion - fill the inside of the Boundary with a hash.
* Inclusion - surround the Boundary with a nominated size hash
* Neither - just draw the Boundary Line with no hash

===== Show Boundary Point Icons

This sets whether to show or not the boundary points on a boundary.

==== Boundary Point

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_preferences_-_boundary_point.png[image,width=587,height=610]

===== Arrival Radius

This is not really relevant to a Boundary Point at the moment, but may
become useful if other items/capabilities are added

===== Show Name

This is the default setting for showing the Boundary Point name.
Currently Boundary Points are created with the name empty/blank so
nothing displays.

===== Icon

This is the default icon to use for all Boundary Points. There is a set
of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The
method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN
manual

===== Show Range Rings

Boundary Points can have range rings associated with them. To show the
rings by default this setting needs to be checked.

===== Boundary Point Type

This radio button selection sets the default type for all Boundary
Points.

* Exclusion - fill the inside range rings with a hash.
* Inclusion - surround the largest range ring with a nominated size hash
* Neither - just draw the range rings but there is no hash

===== Fill Density

This allows the setting of how transparent the fill hash is. A value of
0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is
fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low
density - you can see through it, high density - you cannot see through
it.

===== Boundary Point Inclusion Size

This defines, in pixels, how wide the hash is around the outside
Boundary Point Range Ring when the Boundary Point is of type
'Inclusion'.

===== Number of Range Rings

This defines the number of range rings to show if they are selected to
be shown. If Zero is selected, then there will be no range ring shown.

===== Distance Between Range Rings

This is the gap between sucessive range rings. The measurement this is
using is defined in the Distance Unit' setting

===== Distance Unit

The unit of measurement to use for the range rings gap. It can be:

* Nautical Miles
* Kilometers

===== Range Ring colors

This is the default color to use for any Boundary Point Range Ring. When
selected a standard, platform dependant, color picker will be presented.
This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is
supported by the platform.

===== Range Ring Line Width

This is the width of the range rings when drawn in pixels. It can be a
value between 1 and 10 pixels.

===== Range Ring Line Style

This defines how the Range Rings are drawn. It can be one of the
following:

* Solid
* Dot
* Long Dash
* Short Dash
* Dot Dash

Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the
resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution
screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be
difficult to see.

==== Text Point

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_preferences_-_text_point.png[image,width=702,height=566]

===== Text Point Icon

This is the default icon to use for all Text Points. There is a set of
OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The method
of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN manual.

===== Text Position

This selects where the text is positioned relative to the location of
the Text Point. If you show an Icon it will be easier to see and
interact with the text on the screen. If you do not use an Icon it may
be easier to use the Path Manager to get to the Text Point.

There are 7 different locations:

* Top
* Top center
* Bottom
* Bottom center
* center
* Right
* Left

===== Text color

This is the color that the default Display Text will have. Selection is
by a platform specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform.

===== Background color

When a Text Point displays text it will have a colored background to
help it stand out from the underlying chart. This is the default color
of the background box. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red,
Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform.

===== Background Density

This allows the setting of how transparent the background color. A value
of 0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is
fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low
density–you can see through it, high density–you cannot see through it.
The default density is 100.

===== Maximum Width Type

This selects either Font metric based sizing or Charcter count for
wrapping the displayed text. In Font Based the font being used will
determine where the wrapping occurs. In Character Based the count of the
characters will determine where the wrapping occurs.

===== Maximum Text Width

Depending on the selection of Maximum Width Type will determine the
meaning of this number. In Font Based it is a virtual number more
closely related to the number of pixels available to display the text.
In Character Based this is the count of the maximum number of characters
allowed on any line.

In Font Based the text will only be wrapped if there is a space in the
text. Also, if the value is set too low there will be now wrapping of
the text. To use this method you will need to tune your value dependent
on the font being used. There is no relationship between this number and
the number of characters that will be used on any particular line.

In Character Based this is the maximum number of characters that will be
displayed on any line. Line breaks will occur on spaces, if they are
available, but if there are no spaces then the line will be broken at
this number of characters.

===== Text Font

This is the default font to be used for the 'Display Text'. The 'Fonts'
button will allow picking of any font that is installed on the system.
You can pick the Family, Style and Size of the font. This is presented
by a platform specific font picker. The current font that will be used
is shown by the work 'Example' which will be drawn using the font
selected.

===== Show Display Text

This is the default for when the Display Text of a Text Point is shown.

* Always - Display text is always shown
* On Rollover Only - The text will be displayed when the mouse pointer
rolls over the Text Point. This is to try and help declutter the screen
if there are many objects being concurrently displayed.
* Never - The display text is not displayed

==== Path (this item is currently hidden)

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od-preferences-path.png[image]

===== Active Line color

This is the color of an active generic Path if there is no specific
type. Currently this is not used as there are no unspecified Path types
in use. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will
allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported
by the platform.

===== Inactive Line color

This is the color of an inactive generic Path if there is no specific
type. Currently this is not used as there are no unspecified Path types
in use. Selection is by a platform specific color picker. This will
allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color that is supported
by the platform.

===== Line Width

This is the width of the Path Line in pixels. It can be a value between
1 and 10 pixels.

===== Line Style

This defines how the Path Line is drawn. It can be one of the following:

* Solid
* Dot
* Long Dash
* Short Dash
* Dot Dash

Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the
resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution
screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be
difficult to see.

==== Electronic Bearing Line (EBL)

image:../../../manual/plugins/odraw/1.6/od_preferences_-_ebl.png[image,width=587,height=611]

===== Start Point Icon

This is the default icon to use for the start point of an EBL. There is
a set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons.
The method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main
OpenCPN manual.

===== End Point Icon

This is the default icon to use for the end point of an EBL. There is a
set of OpenCPN icons that can be used as well as user defined icons. The
method of adding user defined icons is documented in the main OpenCPN
manual.

===== Active EBL Line color

This is the color of an active EBL. Selection is by a platform specific
color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
color that is supported by the platform.

===== Inactive EBL Line color

This is the color of an inactive EBL. Selection is by a platform
specific color picker. This will allow the color to be any RGB (Red,
Green, Blue) color that is supported by the platform.

===== Line Width

This is the width of the EBL in pixels. It can be a value between 1 and
10 pixels.

===== Line Style

This defines how the EBL is drawn. It can be one of the following:

* Solid
* Dot
* Long Dash
* Short Dash
* Dot Dash

===== EBL Fixed End Position

This the default for all EBLs. This fixes the End Point of an EBL such
that when the boat moves the end point does not. If this is left uncheck
the end point of the EBL will move with the boat so the EBL always has
the same length and bearing.

===== Show EBL Direction Arrow

This is the default for all EBLs. If checked a direction arrow will be
displayed on the EBL at or near the end point. This helps show the
direction of the EBL.

===== Show VRM

This draws a Variable Range Marker (Ring) centered on the start point
and sized to go through the end point.

===== Show Perpendicular Index Line

This shows a line drawn perpendicular to the end of the EBL. The line
uses the same attributes as are applied to the EBL itself.

Some of these may not display well on your screen depending on the
resolution you are using. It is known that when using high resolution
screens, i.e. 3800×1900 the difference between the line types may be
difficult to see.

===== Fill Density

This allows the setting of how transparent the fill hash is. A value of
0 means that it is fully transparent and a value of 255 is that it is
fully opaque. The term density is used as it seemed clearer, i.e. low
density - you can see through it, high density - you cannot see through
it.

===== Rotate with Boat

This locks the GZ to either the heading the course over ground of the
boat. If this is unset then the GZ will move with the boat but will be
at a fixed direction from the boat irrespective of its course or
heading.

=== OCPN_Draw directories

OCPN_Draw uses a set of directories to hold information and data, these
directories are within the OpenCPN directory structure but linked to
this plugin. The directories which are used are platform and
installation dependent, however, the location can be found in the 'OCPN
Draw Properties' dialog under the 'About' tab. This dialog is accessible
from the 'OpenCPN Options', 'Plugins' dialog page. This will show the
location of the 'data' sub-directory where the ODnavobj.xml files are
kept. The other directories are siblings of the data directory and are
'Layers' and 'UserIcons', which hold data related to their names.

=== Possible Future Improvements:

*Match* +
It might be nice to have a way to “match” a text entity which is a way
of copying all the font, color, background color and transparency
information. To clone the properties of an object and not necessarily
the object itself. So, the idea is to copy some of the attributes,
colour, text, icon from one point to another, but leaving the lat, lon,
GUID, name? remember the “the change all icons for boundaries” you have
implemented already.

=== Croatia Anchorages Script

Jobe39 has created a Simple Python File to convert gpx file from
http://www.anchoragesincroatia.net/p/map-download.html for the OpenCPN
draw plugin.

== FAQ

=== Why can't EBL lat/long be copied or changed?

The EBL is really defined as a length and direction from a starting
point, the default being the boat. The ODPoints that are used are to
enable moving the end points to a user selected location, which really
translates into a length and direction. If you fix the end point, i.e.
it does not move with the boat (a check box is available for this in the
properties) then the end point lat/lon is stable and does not change,
this allows the user to then input the lat/lon they wish. If they then
allow the end point to move, uncheck the check box, it will use the new
lat/lon as the starting point for the EBL.

Copying the lat/lon of a moving point would probably not give you the
answer you were hoping for. As the end point changes as the boat moves
and rotates, the real life probability of getting the lat/lon you
thought you would is unlikely. The way of showing that the lat/lon is
changing is by making these fields read only, i.e. you cannot interact
with them in any way, so there is no way to get the event for copying
them. This is a restriction on the current implementation of wxWidgets.
